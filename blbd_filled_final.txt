The company operates primarily in the school bus industry, with a diverse product range that includes electric, propane, gas, and diesel buses, as well as Type A, C, and D buses. Blue Bird's products are sold through a network of dealerships across the United States and Canada, with a strong presence in the North American market. The company has gained market share over the last trailing 12 months, with a strong win rate and order rate supporting its demand. Blue Bird's competitive position is strengthened by its expansive product range, which is unmatched by its competitors. With a focus on innovation, quality, and customer satisfaction, the company is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the school bus industry.
Here is the paragraph:

Blue Bird Corporation offers a comprehensive range of products, services, and solutions in the school bus industry. Our flagship products include propane, gasoline, diesel, and electric buses, catering to the diverse needs of our customers. We take pride in having the most expansive product range in the industry, with a focus on alternative fuel vehicles, which account for over 60% of our sales. Our propane buses, in particular, are known for their ultra-low emissions and are eligible for rebates and grants from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Additionally, we provide warranties on virtually all of our buses and parts, offering repair, replacement, or adjustment of defective parts during the specified warranty period. We also invest heavily in research and development to enhance our products and services, with a focus on innovation, quality, and customer satisfaction. Our solutions are designed to provide a safe, reliable, and environmentally friendly transportation experience for students, while also meeting the evolving needs of our customers.
Here is the paragraph on the company's latest revenue and profitability metrics:

In fiscal 2024 Q1, the company reported a record gross margin of 20%, 17 percentage points higher than last year, driven by improved operational performance and pricing that has overtaken the inflationary costs of the last 18-plus months. Adjusted net income was approximately $30 million, or $40 million higher than last year. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $48 million, up $51 million and 17 percentage points compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.91, up $1.21 versus the prior year. The company's quarterly revenues have been in the $300 million range and growing, partially due to pricing realization combined with the quarter-by-quarter increase in EV mix, which is now at approximately 10% of sales. Over the last four quarters, the company has generated almost $140 million in adjusted EBITDA, or 11%.
